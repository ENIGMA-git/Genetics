# ENIGMA Protocols for Imputation and Genetic Associations

Anyone is welcome to use these protocols for their projects! If you use the 
protocols on this site for projects outside of ENIGMA, please include a 
reference to the ENIGMA main page (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu/) so that your 
readers and reviewers know about it as well. Please also reference the ENIGMA 
publication if you are using the ENIGMA1 protocols [(Stein et al., 2012, Nature 
Genetics)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504417).

### ENIGMA3
**GWAS Meta Analysis of Cortical Thickness and Surface Area**

Below are the imputation and association protocols for GWAS meta-analysis of 
Cortical ROIs, aka the ENIGMA3 project. Note: For ENIGMA3 we will be using the 
same imputation protocol as used for the ENIGMA2 project.
*   Same Protocol as ENIGMA2: [Imputation Protocol — Updated (July 27, 2012)]
    (ENIGMA2/Imputation)
*   [ENIGMA3 Association Protocols](ENIGMA3)

### ENIGMA2
**GWAS Meta Analysis of Subcortical Volumes**

Below are the imputation and association protocols for GWAS meta-analysis of 
subcortical volumes, aka the ENIGMA2 project.
*   [Imputation Protocol — Updated (July 27, 2012)](ENIGMA2/Imputation)
*   [ENIGMA2 Association Protocol — Method A for Unrelated Samples w/ Only 
    Healthy Subjects](ENIGMA2/AssociationA)
*   [ENIGMA2 Association Protocol — Method B for Unrelated Samples w/ Patients 
    and Healthy Subjects](ENIGMA2/AssociationB)
*   [ENIGMA2 Association Protocol — Method C for Family Designs w/ Only Healthy 
    Subjects](ENIGMA2/AssociationC)

### ENIGMA1 {Legacy Version}
**GWAS Meta Analysis of Hippocampal, Intracranial and Total Brain Volume**

Below are the protocols from the ENIGMA pilot project ([Stein et al., 2012, 
Nature Genetics](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504417)):
*   [Imputation to HapMap III](ENIGMA1/Imputation)
*   [Association Protocol](ENIGMA1/Association)
*   Meta-Analysis Protocol (coming soon!)
*   Until the meta-analysis protocol is posted, an example protocol for 
    meta-analysis used in an international GWAS consortium can be found 
    [here](ENIGMA1/MetaAnalysis). We gratefully thank Margie Wright, Beben, and 
    Peter from Queensland Institute for Medical Research, Australia.
